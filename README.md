Extends [Ryan's Zombies and Demons mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=501966277) for Arma 3 to support the S.O.G. Prairie Fire CDLC.

This adds zombie variants (Walker, Slow, Medium, Fast, Spider, Crawler) for all S.O.G. Prairie Fire units.

**This mod is functional, but unfinished and still in development**

## Installation

**Steam workshop will be added when the mod is completed**

1. Install the [Hemtt](https://github.com/BrettMayson/HEMTT) build tool for Arma 3.
2. Download this Git Repository
3. Run `hemtt build`
4. Copy the folder `.hemttout/build` to your Arma 3 folder, named `@ZombiesAndDemonsVietnam` (or whatever you so choose)

## How do I use this mod?

This adds variants of every unit the S.O.G. Prairie Fire CDLC.

The zombie variants for each unit are identical to their CDLC classnames, but with one of the following postfixes:

- `_zombie_walker`
- `_zombie_slow`
- `_zombie_slow2`
- `_zombie_medium`
- `_zombie_fast`
- `_zombie_spider`
- `_zombie_crawler`

There are also "No brain" variants of the zombies that don't use Ryan's zombie brain, allowing for completely custom scripting. 

These have a `_nobrain` postfix. For example: `vn_b_men_seal_48_zombie_walker_nobrain`
